The Rendezvous Algorithm is a canonical problem in Graph Theoretic Control that recursively drives each agent to the centroid of its neighbors. IFF the network can be considered a connected graph, convergence to a single point is guarunteed. 

Credit to Dr. Yancy Diaz Demercado for teaching me this at University of Maryland.
