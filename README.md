# rendezvousSim

## Todo:
- Iteratively make this less crappy and learn C++ along the way


The Rendezvous Algorithm is a canonical problem in Graph Theoretic Control that recursively drives each agent to the centroid of its neighbors. IFF the network can be considered a connected graph, convergence to a single point is guarunteed.
